Description: A simple, user-friendly Jabber/XMPP client for every device
 It has a modern user-interface made using Kirigami and QtQuick. The back-end
 is completely written in C++ using the XMPP client libraray gloox and Qt 5.
 .
 One of the main ideas behind it is to run the same application on all
 platforms, including mobile and desktop systems. So it even runs on Android.
 .
 Currently there are still many features not implemented, so don't expect it
 to work as a finished client will do.
 .
 This package contains architecture independant files.
